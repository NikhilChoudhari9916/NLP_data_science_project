# NLP Data Science Project
The market for melatonin products is very chaotic, with products of various doses abounding. The aim of this project is to analyze the distribution and user response of various doses of the product based on its data. The datasets are scraped from Amazon.

Project Title: Sentiment Analysis using NLP 

üìå Project Overview
This NLP project focuses on analyzing Amazon reviews for melatonin supplements using spaCy and TF-IDF vectorization. The project aims to extract insights from customer feedback, potentially identifying key themes, sentiment, and product effectiveness

**Key Components:**
Data Collection: Amazon reviews for melatonin supplements are gathered as the primary dataset.

**Text Preprocessing:**

Tokenization using spaCy's advanced NLP capabilities.

Removal of stopwords and punctuation.

Lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.

**Feature Extraction:**

Implementation of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to represent the importance of words in the reviews.

**Analysis:**

Exploration of common themes and keywords in the reviews.

Potential sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction.

Identification of frequently mentioned effects or side effects of melatonin supplements.

**Visualization:**

Creation of word clouds or frequency plots to highlight key terms.

Visualization of sentiment distribution across reviews.
